When you are creating binaries, you sometimes want people to be able to extend your tools with their own functionality. The simplest path has traditionally been exposing a server API for someone to interact with but many security-minded users are averse to the idea of a tool they use running a local http server. You can give your users extensibility without the need for a local http server and at the same time allow them to use any of the languages supported by the Extism toolkit.",

We’ll explore how to access and use the accessibility tree through DevTools and discuss the slight differences in how different browsers render the tree.

Over the past 50 years, computers have grown dramatically more powerful, user interfaces have grown increasingly complex, and computer programs have grown orders of magnitude larger. But despite all this change, we still represent computer code the same way we did in 1970: as plain text files. Why is plain text so ubiquitous, and why do attempts to replace it always fail?\n\nThis talk will explore the different attempts and strategies at making something “better” than plain text  for source formats — including defining what “better” might be in the first place. We’ll cover richer text formats, AST-oriented storage, and more explorations in the future.\n\nBenefits of this talk will include a renewed appreciation for how to share, store, and generally work with your computer code sources.",

This talk will walk through the incredible performance and interoperability opportunities of moving shared web dev tooling to a native-speed language like Rust. You’ll see both how to use these wonderfully fast new tools in your project to unlock speedy and reliable builds immediately.\n\nEven better, you’ll also get an insider’s view of how these projects are built. There’s all sorts of fantastic engineering at play, ranging from re-using test suites from Babel and TypeScript themselves to community-oriented integration tests to ensure compatibility.

			"Writing a technical blog post may sound like a solo task, but in reality it’s just like good software—best with a writer and reviewer/editor. But what does that process look like, and what’s the role of the editor?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll first show elements of a good versus great blog post, with examples. A good post gets the information across in an orderly fashion. A great blog post starts from great source material, and manages to be a page turner. Sometimes, good is all you need, but it’s useful to recognize when you have the potential for great.\n\nNext, I’ll show real examples of specific edits to blog posts I consider good and great. In general, you need to first edit at the macro level \\(e.g. throwing out an entire first draft and choosing a completely different angle\\) and then the micro level \\(e.g. restructuring sentences for clarity\\). The title and opening deserve special attention, and I’ll share tactics you can use to write and refine them.\n\nMarketing your software isn’t just for marketers. These techniques will help you in everything from pull request descriptions to release announcements. I’ll use real material from a series of blog posts we published in spring 2024 at [Render](https://render.com/) to show how much of a difference applying editing craft to communications can make.",

			"Traces are an incredibly useful tool for understanding how your code actually runs function-by-function. With [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) being accepted as standard by vendors and language platforms alike, there has never been a better time to start using it. Yet, many teams adopt traces late in the development cycle when code is hard to change and new tools always take time and money to learn.\n\nThis talk will show you how you can get started using tracing locally and what you can get out of it. It will discuss the benefits you get from well-traced applications and why it is so hard to get there.  We’ll cover what makes tracing hard, how to smooth out those rough edges and get you debugging your code in no time!",

			"Have you ever started a simple project, wanted something to exist, and ended up spending all your time building it yourself? I recently went from building static sites, to building my own static site generator, to writing a new HTML parser and then language server from scratch.\n\nThis talk will guide you through that process of how my yak-shaving stack evolved over time, starting with using TreeSitter as a parser, and culminating in the [Zine](https://zine-ssg.io/) static site generator and [SuperHTML](https://github.com/kristoff-it/superhtml) language server. We’ll cover both why those things are useful and how they actually work under the hood.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will have concluded I’m a maniac, or you will have developed your own appreciation for occasionally building things from scratch. Likely both.",

			"Did you know web animations have their own dedicated browser dev tools? Come learn how to debug timeline based animations in the browser and share animation specs across teams!\n\nOften design happens in Figma and development happens in components. During that hand-off, motion and interaction design can fall through the cracks. But there are great tools and techniques that marry development and design, bringing life and personality to your UI.\n\nWe’ll start with the basics needed to add some visual interest to any project and escalate all the way to integrating complex, orchestrated animations from a motion design team into your workflow.  We’ll also cover CSS animation utility libraries, easing tools for creating custom eases and springs, using the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API) to react to and chain animation events.",

			"Excellent tools are at the heart of every performance optimization workflow. From synthetic testing, auditing, and diagnosing performance issues to collecting and analyzing performance data from real-world user experiences. A good performance workflow utilizes both real-world _and_ synthetic tooling to help you understand how fast your site is and how to make it faster.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore Google's recommended web performance tooling workflow for fast [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals). We'll focus on Chrome DevTools and the powerful [Performance panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance) to get a better understanding of what's happening under the hood. We'll also look at a typical data pipeline for collecting and analyzing real-user data to get a better understanding of the top performance issues and opportunities. Finally, we'll look at a few techniques to significantly improve some of the most common and impactful issues with loading performance and interaction responsiveness.",

			"Sigh, your docs are broken and outdated. But here's the good news: they don’t have to be!\n\nDocumentation is a reflection of the quality of your dev tooling, so if it's broken and outdated that sets the tone for your product's reputation. I empathize with you: as your tooling constantly evolves, keeping documentation up-to-date is challenging, especially when managing multiple programming languages. You already have so much going on. Docs are important, and your time is too.\n\nJoin Rizèl for a session on working smarter \\(and not harder\\) with practical techniques for integrating documentation into your development workflows. Rizèl will share how to efficiently treat your developer docs as code to ensure your documentation remains reliable and current.",
